# civic-panel
The CIViC-Panel Project will be used to identify variants within the CIViC Database that will be used in the CIViC Biomarker Capture Panel.  All variants will undergo selection criteria to filter out variants within the database that do not meet selection standards.  Additionally, the CIViC-Panel will create an automated way to design probes for selected variatns so that subsequent additions to the CIViC Database can be quickly incorporated into the CIViC Capture Panel.

## Installation

civic-panel requires Python 3.5.  Prior to running any installation stepls, check the Python Version installed on your system:

`python -V`

If your python version is outdated, we recommend using <a href="http://conda.pydata.org/docs/py2or3.html">Conda</a> to emulate a Python 3.5. environment.
