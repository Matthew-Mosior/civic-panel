This folder contains input files for all scripts used to generate the smMIPs panel

1) panel_genes.txt = list of genes with total number of panels where gene is implicated to determine variants that are externally considered clinically relevant.

2) tile_classification.txt = list of genes that have been manually curated for tile consideration. Genes with a 'yes' label in the tile column will have the protein coding exons tiled completely in the CIViC panel. Genes with a 'no' label in the tile colum are eligible for SNP/INDEL design.

3) tile_classification_backup.txt = copy of tile_classificaiton because sometimes when I change the code it gets overwritten so I back it up!
