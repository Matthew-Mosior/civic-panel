This folder contains output files for all scripts used to generate the smMIPs panel

1) capture_sequence_probes.tsv = output from probe_selection.py for all variants that need to be covered for DNA-sequencing methods

2) nanoString_probes.tsv = output from probe_selection.py for all variants that need to be covered for RNA-sequencing methods

3) exon_coordinates.txt = output of all exon coordinates that require tiling

4) exon_coordinates_merged.txt = merge of all overlapping exon coordinates that require tilint

5) single_probe coordinates.txt = output of all single probe coordinates that require tiling

6) single_probe coordinates_merged.txt = merge of all overlapping single probe coordinates that require tiling

7) ten_coordinates.txt = output of all probe coordinates for regions that requre only 10-15 probes across all exon coding coordinates

8) ten_coordinates_merged.txt = merge of all overlapping probe coordinates for regions that requre only 10-15 probes across all exon coding coordinates
